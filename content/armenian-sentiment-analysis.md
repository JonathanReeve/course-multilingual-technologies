title: "Building Armenian Sentiment Analysis Tools using mBERT and Neural Networks"
description: "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that summarizes the usersâ€™ thoughts towards a specific topic. As a low resource language, Armenian does not have NLP tools to conduct sentiment analysis, much less social media posts. Our research aims to fill this gap, by outlining and comparing two models for Armenian sentiment analysis: one based on multilingual BERT and the other on a pre-trained English sentiment model. We apply our sentiment analysis tool not only as a means for conducting research into the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but also as a validation component against prior work. Our results show that our model is significantly better than random guessing but there is much more work to be done to improve its accuracy. Ultimately, building sentiment analysis models using native Armenian word embeddings is the ideal route, although future work in expanding labelled datasets and accounting for dialect differences is needed."

The complexities in expanding digital support, not limited to natural language processing alone, for low-resource languages has long been a challenge. Low-resource languages not only face social challenges from the lack of extensive investments in development but also technological barriers from scientists focusing on trending topics. Today, we introduce a framework for building Armenian sentiment analysis tools such that Armenian can continue to move up the digital vitality scale.

We aimed to build Armenian sentiment analysis tools which we could use to conduct research on Armenian social media posts regarding the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. We wanted to understand the collective emotions of Armenians regarding this conflict, and see whether sentiment would differ when analyzed in another language such as English. Furthermore, an important question we wanted to answer was which type of machine learning framework would be best suited for conducting sentiment analysis in Armenian.
