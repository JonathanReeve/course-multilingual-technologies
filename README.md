# Multilingual Technologies and Language Diversity

A website for the course, Multilingual Technologies and Language Diversity, taught at Columbia University in 2020 and 2021, by Prof. Smaranda Muresan and Dr. Isabelle Zaugg. 

## Students: submit your final project

Students, to submit your final projects, submit a pull request to this repository, where you add a new markdown file to the `content` folder. See [the example](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-multilingual-technologies/blob/master/content/first-post.md). 

If you've never written markdown before, see [this cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet). 
 - You can insert LaTeX equations by surrounding them with `$`. 
 
And if you've never submitted a pull request before, see [the instructions in the example](https://github.com/JonathanReeve/course-multilingual-technologies/blob/master/content/first-post.md), or [one of the many tutorials for GitHub pull requests](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=github+pull+request&ia=web). Let us know if you have any questions.

## Building

Students typically won't need to do this. But if you want to build and run this site locally, for some reason, make sure you have Nix installed, and then:

```bash
nix-shell --run 'ghcid -T ":main -wS"'
```

This launches a web server at http://localhost:8080 serving the statically generated content. Changing either `./src/Main.hs` or the content in `./content` reloads everything.
