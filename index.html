</strong>Ciaran Beckford, Newman Cheng, Selena Huang, Lingsi Kong</p><p>Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that summarizes the users’ thoughts towards a specific topic. As a low resource language, Armenian does not have NLP tools to conduct sentiment analysis, much less social media posts. Our research aims to fill this gap, by outlining and comparing two models for Armenian sentiment analysis: one based on multilingual BERT and the other on a pre-trained English sentiment model. We apply our sentiment analysis tool not only as a means for conducting research into the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, but also as a validation component against prior work. Our results show that our model is significantly better than random guessing but there is much more work to be done to improve its accuracy. Ultimately, building sentiment analysis models using native Armenian word embeddings is the ideal route, although future work in expanding labelled datasets and accounting for dialect differences is needed.</p></li><li class="pages"><a href="/article/first-post.html">Example Final Project
