Networks
</h1><article><p>The complexities in expanding digital support, not limited to natural language processing alone, for low-resource languages has long been a challenge. Low-resource languages not only face social challenges from the lack of extensive investments in development but also technological barriers from scientists focusing on trending topics. Today, we introduce a framework for building Armenian sentiment analysis tools such that Armenian can continue to move up the digital vitality scale.</p>
<p>We aimed to build Armenian sentiment analysis tools which we could use to conduct research on Armenian social media posts regarding the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. We wanted to understand the collective emotions of Armenians regarding this conflict, and see whether sentiment would differ when analyzed in another language such as English. Furthermore, an important question we wanted to answer was which type of machine learning framework would be best suited for conducting sentiment analysis in Armenian.</p></article></body></html>
